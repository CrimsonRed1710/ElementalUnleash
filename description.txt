All the bosses from ExampleMod, with more loot and without ExampleMod's cheats!

Test your fighting prowess against four difficult end-game bosses, including the Abomination and the Spirit of Purity.

Now with a new third boss not found in ExampleMod: the Spirit of Chaos! Guaranteed to be the most challenging boss you'll fight.

Also includes the Phantom, ported over from my tAPI mod then overhauled. It is meant to be fought around the same time as Duke Fishron.

I am also currently in the process of porting everything from my old tAPI mod over to this mod.
